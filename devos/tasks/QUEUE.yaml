    goal: "Bootstrap repo skeleton + SSOT files + make interface"
    context: |
      Initial setup before any project work begins.
      All SSOT files and the make interface must be functional before builders can be deployed.
    spec: |
      - Create all SSOT files under devos/ (AI.md, CONTEXT.md, PROJECT_STATE.md, etc.)
      - Verify Makefile targets: start/triage/pr-check all work
      - Place role files in .claude/.codex/.gemini
    dod:
      - "All SSOT files exist"
      - "make start / make triage / make pr-check work"

    goal: "Run session-start triage routine (A-Mode) and refine rules"
    context: |
      Validate the A-Mode triage process by actually running it.
      At least 2 open questions are needed for testing.
    spec: |
      - Write 2+ open questions in questions/QUEUE.md
      - Run Claude session-start prompt for triage
      - Record results in CONTEXT.md
    dod:

    goal: "(When project chosen) Create UI skeleton with global states + mock-first"
    context: |
      Once a project is decided, create the UI skeleton.
      Implement all states defined in UI_CONTRACT (loading/empty/error/success).
      Use mock data for development even without a real API.
    spec: |
      - Create components per UI_CONTRACT.md screen-level state definitions
      - Build mock data from API_CONTRACT.md example JSON
      - Set up global layout + routing structure
    dod:

    goal: "(When project chosen) Create API skeleton matching API contract + tests"
    context: |
      Once a project is decided, create the API skeleton.
      Implement all endpoints defined in API_CONTRACT.
      Error format must also match the contract.
    spec: |
      - Create routes per API_CONTRACT.md endpoint list
      - Match request/response format to contract example JSON
      - Unify error format (per contract)
      - Write basic tests for each endpoint
    dod:
      - "endpoints exist per API contract"
      - "error format matches contract"
